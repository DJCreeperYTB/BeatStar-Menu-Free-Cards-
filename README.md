| Version | Description                                               |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.0     | 1 single page (menu)                                      |
| 1.1     | Display bug fix                                           |
| 2.0     | New “Latest Links” page                                   |
| 3.0     | New “Search for links” page                               |
| 3.1     | Added “BeatStar Discord” and “DJCreeper Discord” buttons  |
| 3.2     | Bug fix in “Search for links”                             |
| 4.0     | Added "Blog" to the main menu.                            |
| 4.1     | Bug fix in the blog.                                      |
| 4.2     | Adding emoji to the blog. (Current version)               |
| 4.3     | Images removed (BeatStar logo and DJCreeper logo)         |
| 5.0     | "Search for links" was a useless feature, so I removed it |
| 5.1     | “Latest Links” becomes “Free Cards”                       |
| 5.2     | The French version is no longer available. I created it   |
|         | because it is my native language and it was easier for me |
|         | but managing the translation of two languages ​​is way too  |
|         | complex for me. So "BeatStar_EN" and "BeatStar_FR" are    |
|         | combined into one website in English: "BeatStar".         |
| 5.3     | The last 30 links have been removed, because their rewards|
|         | are no longer valid.                                      |
| 5.4     | 5 new links have been added.
